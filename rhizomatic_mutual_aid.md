# Rhizomatic mutual aid![italian](README.md)

![mutuo-soccorso-rizomatico](mutuo-soccorso-rizomatico.png)

We are experiencing a dystopian reality that until a few months ago we could only
trace in some sci-fi movies.
The body becomes obsolete and our lives enters a purely cognitive dimension. 
Individuals alternate between the risk of contagion due to the obligation to go to work and continue to produce, smart-working on platforms with algorithms that calculate the percentage of attention and find forms of home entertainment.
Our bodies pour out in front of screens trying to reunite virtually, the great social
network platforms thank and toast for the surge in profits.
However, not everything can be done virtually. We who are musicians, makers,
hackers, programmers, VJs and DJs used to collective social moments have been
forced to make these moments purely individual.
We have tried to bridge the distance with the public through direct streaming of
singles, one at a time, each with its own portion of time available. But the true col-
lective artistic process of action and fruition cannot be rendered virtually.
Networking means creating relationship networks, sharing experiences and ideas,
creating contexts in which people can feel free to communicate and create artisti-
cally, in a "horizontal" way, so that the broadcaster and recipient, artist and public
get confused, lose their original meaning.
BitNet01 and Audio HackLab are two collectives made up of people who live hun -
dreds of kilometers apart who in recent weeks have felt the need to translate a col-
lective feeling into reality: play together even in isolation, devising escape lines and
technical solutions outside from commercial logic and proprietary platforms.
The definition of mutual aid starts from the Latin word mutuus and the word aid
which indicates help in times of need. Mutual aid companies are voluntary mem-
bership-based institutions in which members adhere to the principle of mutual aid,
non-profit or individual enrichment. Given the historical origin of the term, today we
want to give it a meaning of human solidarity made up of virtually joint bodies that
develop tools to help all of us.
The term rhizomatic derives from rhizome which in botany is a particular type of
root where any point is connected to any other point in a non-hierarchical way:
there is no center, no direction, only concatenations. The rhizome expands in all
directions and this creates multiplicity. In philosophy Gilles Deleuze and Felix
Guattari place the concept of rhizome at the center of a widespread organizational
model capable of describing and changing social and cultural processes.The two French philosopher recognize the real need to become "rhizomatic" to
truly creative and open to change thinking, in order to reverberate in a potentially
advantageous way both for the individual and for the community.
Networked Music Performance is a real-time interaction on a computer network
that allows musicians from different places to perform as if they were in the same
room. A prime example of NMP is the composition "Imaginary Landscape No. 4 for
Twelve Radios" by composer John Cage. The piece used transistor radios as a
musical instrument. Today we are referring to the technical possibility of playing
together despite the latency and bandwidth of the connections.
For this purpose, we have decided to make available two NINJAM servers, a soft-
ware that allows you to play synchronized via the Internet. Any participant can lis-
ten to any other participant. Each user can also edit their own personal mix as they
wish. NINJAM is a software licensed under the GNU GPL2 Free Software and uses
OGG Vorbis audio compression to compress audio and reduce latencies.

BitNet01 in an open experimental space that promotes participatory processes to co-de-
fine and co-design our relationship with technology and devices. Bitnet01 started in Con-
servatorio "G. Rossini" Pesaro (Italy).
Audio HackLab is an artist collective, born to create new instruments, weird musical ma-
chines and to explore new music practices. AHL started in 2014 in Torino (Italy).
